// clues: crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. //

-- 1. Retrieving crime scene report from database using given clues 

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder' 
AND city = 'SQL City'
AND date = '20180115'

/* RESULT: Returns 1 incident matching all given clues. Description of the incident reads 
"Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. 
The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". 
The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave". */

-- 2. Finding more about our witnesses and their statements, let's dive into the interview table.

---- First, I want to find out the last address number on Northwestern Dr.

SELECT MAX(address_number)
FROM person

/* RESULT: 4919 */

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE address_number = '4919' OR
name LIKE '%Annabel%' AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'

/* RESULT: Our two witnesses: 
14887	Morty Schapiro LicenseID: 118009	4919	Northwestern Dr	111564949
16371	Annabel Miller	490173	103	Franklin Ave	318771143
*/

---- Retrieving their statements using their IDs

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = '14887' OR
person_id = '16371'

/* RESULT: 
Witness #1 14887	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. 
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
Witness #2 16371	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
*/

-- 3. Okay, now I want to know who matches the descriptions: Gold status, male, 
"48Z" membership, license plate "H42W" and checked in on 01/09.

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE membership_status = 'gold' AND id LIKE '%48Z%'

/* RESULT: 
48Z7A	28819	Joe Germuska	20160305	gold
48Z55	67318	Jeremy Bowers	20160101	gold
*/

---- Which one of these two checked in on 01/09? 

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE check_in_date = '20180109' 
AND membership_id = '48Z7A' OR membership_id = '48Z55'

/* RESULT: They both went to the gym that day */

---- Which one owns a car with a license plate that includes "H42W" and is a male?

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
WHERE plate_number LIKE '%H42W%' 
AND gender = 'male'

/* RESULT: 
423327	30	70	brown	brown	male	0H42W2	Chevrolet	Spark LS
664760	21	71	black	black	male	4H42WR	Nissan	Altima
*/


-- 4. FINALLY! I will now use the license ID numbers above to match them with either suspects.

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE license_id = '423327' OR
license_id = '664760'

/* RESULT: 2 names came back but only one matching one of the guys mentioned: Jeremy Bowers is the murderer. */

-- Let's check:

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
        
        SELECT value FROM solution;

/*
Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript 
of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. 
If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. 
Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.
*/

----- BUT WAIT!!! There's more to the story. -----

/*

-- #1 Let's pull our witnesses statements again but this time we will include our murderer's statement as well!

SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = '14887' OR
person_id = '16371' OR
person_id = '67318'

/* RESULT: 
Jeremy Bower's statement reads "I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017."
*/ 

-- #2 OMG!!! Let's find the mastermind behind all of this!

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license 
WHERE 
height BETWEEN 65 AND 67 
AND 
gender = 'female' AND
hair_color = 'red' AND
car_make = 'Tesla' AND
car_model = 'Model S'


/* RESULT:
202298	68	66	green	red	female	500123	Tesla	Model S

918773	48	65	black	red	female	917UU3	Tesla	Model S
*/


SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE license_id = '202298' OR 
license_id = '291182' OR 
license_id = '918773'

/* RESULT:

SELECT *
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE person_id = '78818' OR 
person_id = '90700' OR 
person_id = '99716'

/* RESULT:

99716	1143	SQL Symphony Concert	20171212

*/

SELECT *
FROM person
WHERE id = '99716'

/* RESULT: 
99716	Miranda Priestly	202298	1883	Golden Ave	987756388
*/

-- Let's check again! 



INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Miranda Priestly');
        
        SELECT value FROM solution;


/* Congrats, you found the brains behind the murder! 
Everyone in SQL City hails you as the greatest SQL detective of all time. Time to break out the champagne!
